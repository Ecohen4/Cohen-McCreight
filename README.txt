This repository contains R scripts for accessing, downloading, subsetting and cleaning climate data from various international climate databases.  The data come in all shapes and sizes (e.g. flat files, netCDF, tar.zip, etcâ€¦) and our goal here is to extract various data from the various sources and put them into easy-to-use data.frames in R.  Once we have the requisite data in data.frames, we can easily proceed with analysis.

To save space, this github repository contains only R scripts and a few **clean** cvs files.  Large data files are kept elsewhere (dropbox) or, better yet, accessed as needed directly from the source URL.

IMPORTANT:
If you would like to fork this repository for your own use (research, commercial or otherwise), you MUST cite and credit the author (Elliot Cohen) and core contributors (Mike Piccirilli, Henri Torbey, and Yu Tian) accordingly. Open a PR or Issue to start the conversation!

Thanks!
